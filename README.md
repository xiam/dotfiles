# dotfiles

The settings I use for development.

This is my preferred stack:

* [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
* [vim](http://www.vim.org/)
* [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
* [git](http://git-scm.com/)

I have been using these tools for a long time and I am very happy with them.
Nothing fancy, just what I need and works for me.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/xiam/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
make
```
